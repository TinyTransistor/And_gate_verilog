# Verilog AND Gate

This repository contains my Verilog HDL implementation of a simple AND gate,
including a testbench to verify its logic.

## Files
- `and_gate.v` — AND gate module
- `tb_and_gate.v` — Testbench for the AND gate

## Learning Goals
- Understand Verilog modules
- Use inputs, outputs, wires
- Learn basic continuous assignment
- Practice simple testbench
